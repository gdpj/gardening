            <p><h3>Modern Roses are the most widespread variety of roses found in gardens today. These are varieties bred after 1867.  Modern Roses bloom all year long, in contrast to Old Garden Roses. Although some claim they lack the hardiness, disease resistance, and scent of Old Garden roses, they typically have greater bloom sizes.</h3></p>
