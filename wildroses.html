            <div class="hp"><p><h3>In the realm of roses, wild roses are the rebellious teenager! They go by the name species roses as well because they are native species of rose. These roses are those that haven't undergone hybridization, thus they naturally exist. Additionally, they are usually having a single flower with the corolla consisting of one circle of five roundish,spreading petals . Their coloration is almost invariably pink.</h3></p>

            <h3>Lady Bank's Yellow Rose</h3>
            <p>Rosa banksiae 'Lutea' (Lady Bank's Yellow Rose) is a thornless climbing wild rose that consistently bears masses of mildly scented, petite double butter-yellow blooms in the spring that cover all nearby plants and structures like blankets and garlands. It was reportedly seen growing in a Calcutta botanic garden previous to John Parks' official introduction of it from China in 1824.</p>

                <h3>Memorial Rose</h3>
                <p>Originally from the eastern region of Asia, the memorial rose is a robust groundcover or vining shrub in the Roseaceae (rose) family.  It grows as dense thickets and is found in lowlands, mountainous regions, and coastal places.  The name comes from German botanist Max Ernst Wichura (1817–1866).  

                    This semi-evergreen trailing vine can swiftly grow to be 16 feet tall and wide. It does not provide a solid cover, but it can create a barrier and scramble up huge trees or other structures.  The spectacular fragrant white blooms and lustrous, dark green leaves occur in the summer, followed by the dark crimson rose hips.</p>
