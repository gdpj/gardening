            <p><h4>Anyone can successfully cultivate roses because rose care is simpler than you might imagine. Your roses should be planted in a sunny area with sufficient drainage. For stunning flowers, give them regular fertiliser. To keep the soil moist, water them consistently. Early in the spring, prune established rose plants. Keep an eye out for conditions like black spot or powdery mildew.If you've been hesitant to plant roses in your yard, you should know that they require no more maintenance than other flowering bushes. To learn how to grow roses, abide by these ten fundamental guidelines:</h4></p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>1.Start with the roots</p>
            <p>You can purchase roses already potted in soil or as dormant bare-root plants. Each type has its benefits:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Container roses: Container roses are a great for novice gardeners because they’re easy to plant and establish quickly. They can also be purchased at local nurseries throughout the growing season. This allows you to plant them when climate conditions are ideal— preferably a cool and cloudy day.</li>
                <li>Bare-root roses: One of the advantages of bare-root roses is the greater selection of varieties available. Plus, they are economical and can be ordered online. However, unlike container roses, bare-root plants need to have their roots soaked overnight in water before planting. Also, the roots should be kept moist for the first few months after planting.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>2. Pick your roses carefully</p>

            <ul>
                <li>There are various classifications of roses, some of which have hundreds of varieties, ranging from micro-miniatures to grandifloras, groundcovers to climbing roses. Even while it could be alluring to pack your rose garden with a variety, you'll probably end up with a disorganised layout and too many plants for the available space. You'll be happier with a few carefully chosen types than with a lot of poorly matched plants that don't get along.</li>
                <li>Try shrub or landscape roses, such as the Oso Easy range, for lesser maintenance roses for a less fussy rose garden.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>3.Plant properly</p>
            <p>Your bare-root or container roses will start off well if you plant them appropriately.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The planting hole must be large and deep enough to accommodate the roots of the plant. Since roses don't enjoy having their feet wet, the location needs to have sufficient drainage.</li>
                <li>The dirt that was taken out of the planting hole should be generously mixed with garden compost, peat moss, or another organic material.</li>
                <li>Place the rose bush in the planting hole after adding part of this mixture to the bottom.</li>
                <li>In mild regions, the plant's crown should be at ground level; in cold areas, it should be 2 to 3 inches below ground level.</li>
                <li>Place a slow-release fertiliser in the hole after partially filling it with the soil mixture.</li>
            </ul>
