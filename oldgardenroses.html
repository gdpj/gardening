            <p><h3>An old garden rose is defined as any rose belonging to a class which existed before the introduction of the first modern rose, La France, in 1867. Heritage and historic roses are other names for this category.</h3></p>
            <p><h3>Old Garden roses are often woody shrubs with double-flowered, noticeably fragrant blooms that are usually white, pink, or crimson-red in colour. They are typically of European or Mediterranean origin. Actual Old Garden rose varieties can be difficult to identify and fall into five different categories: Gallicas, Damasks, Albas, Centifolias, and Moss roses.</h3></p>

                        <td><span style="color : #c8c8c8">Gallicas sare the oldest of all Old Garden roses and have influenced nearly all Old Garden roses even to today. They were originally grown by the Greeks and Romans and later by the Dutch and French, as reflected in their names.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <span style="color : #c8c8c8">Gallicas range from shades of pink, red and purple to deep crimson red with stripes. The single, double, or semi-double blooms are held alone or in groups of three. The bushes are low suckering shrubs with oval foliage that is pointed and rough in texture. It is typically dark green.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Gallicas require very little attention and can grow well in poor, gravelly soil.</td>

                        <td><span style="color : #cacaca">Damask originated in the eastern Mediterranean and were grown by Egyptians, Greeks, Persians, and Romans. They are extraordinarily fragrant and have a parenting mix from a Gallica rose and a wild Species rose.
                        <br>
                        <br>They are cold hardy, even growing in zone 4, but are very thorny and have an arching growth habit. They reach about three to seven feet tall and most only bloom once a year.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <span style="color : #cacaca">Damask roses, unlike Gallicas, need good fertile soil to thrive.</td>
                        <td> <span style="color : #cacaca">Albas are the most elegant of the old roses. They produce tall, slender growth with blush pink or white flowers and gray-green foliage. Their rich perfume makes them a favorite cut flower.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <span style="color : #cacaca">Albas are cold-hardy for zones 3-9 and can survive even in partial shade.</td>
