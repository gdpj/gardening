            <p><h2>PLANNING A ROSE GARDEN</h2></p>
            <p>  <strong>Choose your site:</strong><br>
                 Make sure the site gets at least 6-8 hours of sun a day and has good air circulation to help prevent disease.</p>

            <p><strong>Make a plan:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Gather ideas from books and online sources for inspiration.</li>
                <li>Draw up a rough sketch as you’re brainstorming to help visualize what the finished garden will look like.</li>
                <li>Include pathways for easy access.</li>
                <li>Beds should be small enough to allow for pruning and other maintenance chores.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Choose a style:</strong><br>
                Decide what kind of rose garden you want. Do you want a clean formal look with structured hardscape, or a more natural appearance with other plants mixed in? Pick a style that will harmonize with your home’s exterior.</p>
                
            <p><strong>Pick a color scheme:</strong><br>
                Select colors that you enjoy and that will also help unify the home with the landscape.</p>

            <p><strong>Large rose garden:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Create a design with formal rooms or mixed borders that are grand in scale so it doesn’t get lost in the surrounding landscape.</li>
                <li>Keep scale in mind when adding hardscape, seating and structures such as arbors and pergolas, which are typically included in rose gardens.</li>
                <li>Choose larger rose varieties that will show up better in the landscape.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Backyard rose garden:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Include seating areas in different parts of the yard, which will encourage you to spend more time enjoying your rose garden.</li>
                <li>Place a bench, water feature, or statuary at the far end of the rose garden to draw the eye through the landscape and encourage visitors to wander and linger.</li>
            </ul>

            <img src="3108fc5d-7c2e-42f7-a042-4ff4a4199b1c.jpg">

            <p><strong>Grow vertically:</strong><br>
                Include climbing roses to maximize your space. Train other vining plants such as clematis to grow up through shrub or climbing roses to create exciting flower combinations.</p>

            <p><strong>Grow horizontally:</strong><br>
                Train climbers along a fence to define garden rooms or to soften an unsightly chain link fence.</p>

            <p><strong>Plant a hedge:</strong><br>
                Plant a row of taller shrub roses to create privacy from the street. A row of shorter groundcover roses can be planted along a foundation, in a curbside strip, or used to define garden areas.</p>

            <p><strong>Make an entrance:</strong><br>
                Create a grand entrance to your home with an inviting entryway complete with a rose arbor and adjacent plantings to soften the landscape.</p>
